A Unity3D project where there has been an attempt at recreating the famous Final Fantasy Tactics. Project was interrupted after hitting a roadblock on obtaining art assets needed to complete core gameplay.

Only the C# scripts are present in this cloned repository. They aren't perfect, but with further work could be continued on.
